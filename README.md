Extending TextAE for annotation of non-contiguous entities
==========================================================

This is a fork of the [TextAE annotation tool repo](https://github.com/pubannotation/textae). It's a tool to annotate text with entities and relations between those entities. As part of the [BLAH6 hackathon](https://blah6.linkedannotation.org/), we started a project to add the ability to annotate non-contiguous entities (like the ones below) with the interface and data model. This repo contains the changes.

We also did some analysis using PubMed and PubMed Central to try to quantify one type of non-contiguous relations. The code for that can be found in the [analysis/](https://github.com/jakelever/textae/tree/stable/4/analysis) directory.

To build and use the code, we direct you to the documentation in the [original repo](https://github.com/pubannotation/textae).
