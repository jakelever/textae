# Editing Modes

TextAE works in one of the three modes described below:

## View mode (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pubannotation/textae/stable/4/dist/lib/css/images/btn_view_16.png))
* The content cannot be changed, but only viewed.
* When a label is a URL (or associated with a URL), it will become a link to the URL.
* Selection of a part of the text can be performed for copy & paste.

## Term edit mode (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pubannotation/textae/stable/4/dist/lib/css/images/btn_term_16.png))

* Term annotations can be edited.

## Relation edit mode (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pubannotation/textae/stable/4/dist/lib/css/images/btn_relation_16.png))

* Relation annotation can be edited.
* The view mode will be automatically changed to the [Full View mode](/docs/views).
